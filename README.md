# Encourage-Bot
So I created a discord bot that encourages you when you're sad.
<br>
You can also add custom encouraging messages, which will be stored in my repl database. 
<br>
The bot mainly looks for words that seem sad, like depressed, or unhappy, etc. These words are hardcoded as a list. Whenever a word is encountered, a random happy encouraging message is fetched from an API from zenquotes.io which is then sent as a message to the server.
<br>
<br>
## Check out the bot - <a href="https://discord.gg/ncdgFYYZ">Test</a>
Join the server and type down any of the commands found below to test the bot out!<br>
This server also has another bot made by me. I used a random advice API for this one and is kinda funny.<br>
